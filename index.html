                    <p>I am a curious team player who’s strengths include working through ambiguity, persistence with problem solving related to data, systems and processes; and simplifying, contextualising and articulating improvement opportunities to relevant stakeholder groups with the intent of achieving a consensus on implementation priorities. My experience so far has been across various aspects of the mining and banking industries. Additionally, my keen interest in personal and professional development indulges my curiosity towards emerging technologies.</p>
