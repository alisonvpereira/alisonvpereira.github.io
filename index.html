                            <h3>About me:</h3>
                            <p>I am a data enthusiast who is self-motivated, driven by curiosity and bound by loyalty. My natural curiosity helps me specialise in problem solving through investigation and I have gained an advanced knowledge of the systems I use as a result. Working as the conduit between technical areas and end users, my strengths lie in analysis and simplification of highly technical content to educate business users. I especially enjoy cultivating positive relationships by organising team building activities and actively maintain excellent working relationships with colleagues across all levels. I also enjoy engaging in coaching activities as the need arises. I am looking forward to exploring global opportunities within the mining, banking or technology industries.</p>
